"""Human / vehicle / package / pet detection, read and written like sound.

The cameras type their detections today - `humanDetect` is already 1 on both
mains models - and Home Assistant sees none of it, only motion on/off plus a
sensitivity number.

Three things the live probe on 2026-09-07 settled, each of which this locks in:

- The payload is ``{"roi": [{...}]}`` with FIVE flags, the fifth being
  ``petDetect``.
- ``publicZone`` VARIES per camera (0 on an A000088, 1 on an A001064), so it is
  a real setting. A setter must echo the camera's own dict back with one flag
  changed, never rebuild it, or it clobbers a setting it does not model.
- A battery A001513 answers NOTHING - a null ``out``. That has to read as
  *unknown*, never as all-off, or the UI invents a state the camera never
  claimed.
