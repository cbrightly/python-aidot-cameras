"""Fail the run when a test skips for a reason the suite does not expect.

A skipped test ran nothing. A test that needs a tool (ffmpeg, PyAV, numpy)
skips quietly when the tool is missing, and a green run then proves nothing
about what that test covers: the integration's clip test skipped in CI for
want of ffmpeg, and a clip losing its first seconds passed (2026-10-07).

With ``AIDOT_FAIL_ON_SKIP`` set - CI sets it - every skip is checked against
``EXPECTED_SKIP_REASONS``, the reasons that are a deliberate choice of which
test applies (two tests covering the two shapes of an upstream record, one of
which always skips). Any other skip fails the run, with the tests named. Unset,
the guard does nothing.
