"""A wake the camera never gets time to act on is decorative.

`_mqtt_device_cmd` published the low-power wake and the command in ONE batch,
back to back. A deeply asleep battery camera cannot process the wake before the
setDevAttrReq arrives behind it, so the command is dropped and the camera acks
nothing -- while the ack scan still reports success from the broker's own
response.

Measured 2026-09-08 on an A001513 (L2_185): writes to `lightBehavior` never
landed for hours; opening a keepalive session woke the camera in 13 s and the
identical write landed first try; and a wake followed by a 5 s gap then landed
it with no session at all. `Dimming` and `LingerDuration` hid the bug for
months because they land on a sleeping camera anyway -- the cloud shadows them.

These lock the decision, not the timing: the plan says WHETHER to wake and
whether the caller must wait, and a warm window stops a burst of attribute
writes from waking the camera once per attribute.
