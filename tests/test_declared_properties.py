"""What the MODEL declares it has, as distinct from what the cloud reports.

These are not the same thing, and the difference is what makes a control lie.
Measured 2026-09-08 on an A000088:

    cloud property list   LingerDuration = "30"
    the camera, asked
    directly over LAN     LingerDuration = absent
    writing it            acked, and nothing changed anywhere

The cloud carries a DEFAULT for a key that model has never implemented. Gating
a control on "the cloud reported a value" therefore offers it on cameras where
it cannot work -- which is exactly what shipped in 2.23.0 and had to be pulled
back. The vendor app gates on the product profile instead, and so must we.
