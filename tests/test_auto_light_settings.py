"""The camera's "light up when someone appears" settings.

The vendor app calls the master toggle "When Someone Appears" and it is the
`autoLightEnable` attribute this library already exposes. The three settings
that sit UNDER it in the app were missing:

  lightBehavior   enum   Constant=0, Flash=1        (default 0)
  LingerDuration  enum   20 / 30 / 40 / 50 seconds  (default 30)
  Dimming         int    10..100 step 1             (default 100)

Read from the cloud device profile 2026-09-07 (LK.IPC.A001513, the L2), and
every one of the three is carried as a live property value by the L2 and by the
A000088 alike. Of the three, `LingerDuration` and `Dimming` were confirmed on
hardware to land (written, read back changed, restored); `lightBehavior` appeared not to land at all
until 2026-09-08, when the cause turned out to be a battery camera never given
time to wake before the command arrived (fixed in `1.0.0rc18`). It lands now,
and Home Assistant ships a control for it gated on the model profile - only the
A001513 declares it. The A001064 has neither `lightBehavior` nor `LingerDuration` in
its profile or its properties, so those controls must stay absent there rather
than appear reading "unknown" -- which is why every getter here answers None
for a camera that never reported the key.
