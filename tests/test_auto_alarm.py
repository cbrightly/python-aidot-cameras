"""The siren's automatic trigger: on/off, and what sets it off.

`getAutoAlarm` returns `[{autoAlarm, motionDetection, humanDetect}]` -- a master
switch plus which events fire it. Probed on real hardware 2026-09-07, and it is
NOT a mirror of anything already exposed: on an A000088 its `motionDetection`
read 0 while the camera's own motion-detection setting read True, and on an
A001064 its `humanDetect` read 0 while `getRoiHuman`'s read 1. Two independent
settings that happen to share field names.

Same discipline as the detection types: read-modify-write against the camera's
own object so a flag we do not model cannot be reset, and a camera that does not
answer is unknown rather than all-off.
