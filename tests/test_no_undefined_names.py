"""Guard against NameError-class regressions in the camera open paths.

`ast.parse`/`py_compile` only catch syntax errors, not undefined names used at
runtime (e.g. a variable referenced in one method but defined only in another).
That class of bug shipped once (0.5.5/0.5.6: `_fast_connect` referenced in
`_open_sdes_stream` but defined only in `_async_open_webrtc_stream_impl`,
breaking every SDES camera open). This test runs pyflakes and fails on any
undefined name except a small allowlist of intentional closure patterns.

It covers every module where that bug class can live: the three big open paths
carry deeply nested closures whose names are read from sibling scopes, which is
exactly the shape pyflakes catches and review does not.

**pyflakes must be installed for this to mean anything.** It was not - not in
the venv and not in CI - so from the day it was written until 2026-09-07 this
test skipped everywhere and guarded nothing. The dependency is now declared in
CI; if you see it skip locally, `pip install pyflakes` before trusting a green
run.
