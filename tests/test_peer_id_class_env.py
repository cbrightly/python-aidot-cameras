"""An env-var route to pinning the peer id's client class, for screening only.

The camera reads its client class from field 2's first character. Pinning it to
'0' (APP_ANDROID) was tried and reverted: three A000088 cameras went 0 for 3
over nine attempts, each completing DTLS and then receiving no media. That
finding is real - checked against ten live-validation runs, the A000088 is
29/30 PASS with the random character, so a 3% baseline cannot explain 0/9.

But it only ever tested '0'. The vendor WEB app sends '2' (WEB), and that arm
has never been run. `_expt_peer_id_fields` exists to screen this, and it reads
a FILE - which the live-validation harness cannot write, it only passes env
vars. This is that route and nothing more.

It pins ONLY the class character. It deliberately cannot touch the three
trailing integers: those encode transport, and an SDES tail pushed at a DTLS
camera is silently discarded, which is how an earlier unscoped knob forced a
battery camera to ~30x its wake rate.
