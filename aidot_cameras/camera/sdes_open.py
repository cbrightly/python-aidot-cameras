    selections: REMB reuses the PLI's cached SRTP session rather than choosing
    for itself, so instrumenting the PLI covers it.  The two selections do not
    agree.  The PLI encrypts with our own offer key; the RR prefers the camera's
    answer key and falls back to ours.  SRTP keys are per-direction, so at most
    one of those can be the key the camera authenticates our RTCP against.  No
    symptom has ever been reported for any of the three, and until now no log
    line said which key went out, so a live capture could not settle it.

    ``differ=no`` means the camera echoed our key and the two senders were
    identical anyway -- the question does not arise in that session.  A run with
    ``differ=yes`` is the one that answers it, and the PLI is the sender that
    answers it: a PLI the camera authenticates is followed by a keyframe, so a
    ``differ=yes`` session whose PLIs produce keyframes says the offer key is
    the one the camera accepts on this direction.  The RR has no comparably
    sharp outcome -- a camera keeps sending audio whether or not it accepted our
    report -- so the RR line is there to record which key it used, not to prove
    that key right.

    A caller emitting this must emit it again if the key it selects can change:
    ``_cam_key_audio`` is parsed late on the wake path, after the bridge is

    would record ``answer=none differ=no`` for precisely the session in which

    when ``unprotect`` succeeds, so it stays ciphertext whenever there is no

    SRTP leaves the RTP header in clear, so the payload offset comes out right

    ``on_frame`` never fires and these counters are what every health check
    reads: ``SdesSession.last_media_monotonic`` feeds ``SdesSession.is_stalled``,
    the keepalive's ``_healthy`` is ``last_media_monotonic > 0.0``, and
    ``_healthy`` is what resets the streak ``_should_abandon_keepalive`` counts.
    Counting a packet the consumer throws away therefore does not just skew a
    statistic: it makes a session report healthy forever while the viewer sees
    black, because every one of those checks is satisfied by a counter that
    keeps moving.

    The question is not "did we decrypt it" but "is the forwarded packet
    plaintext by the time ffmpeg reads it", and who owes the decryption depends

    * ``plain_rtp`` (``_use_plain_rtp``, the ``_PLAIN_RTP_MODELS`` substring
      allowlist): the ffmpeg SDP is ``RTP/AVP`` with no ``a=crypto``, so the

      ``unprotect`` succeeds, and two paths leave it as ciphertext - no SRTP
      receive session (pylibsrtp is in the optional ``webrtc`` extra) and an
      ``unprotect`` that raised.  ffmpeg discards those, so they are not
      delivered media.  Non-TUTK packets on this path are SRTP by then: the
      camera switches from TUTK SFrames to standard SRTP after LIVING, and the
      SFrames are handled and ``continue``-d well before this point.
    * Otherwise the SDP is ``RTP/SAVP`` with ``a=crypto`` and FFMPEG owes the
      decryption.  Forwarding ciphertext is exactly right there, ``decrypted``
      is always False, and the packet IS delivered media - so the ``plain_rtp``
      term is load-bearing.  ``is_sdes_camera`` is a cloud property
      (``enableSdes == '1'``), a different and wider set than the model
      allowlist, so this path is reachable by any SDES camera not named in it.
      Without the second term such a camera would report ``last_media`` 0.0
      forever, trip ``is_stalled`` at the grace deadline while streaming fine,
      and eventually have its keepalive abandoned.

    Measured on an A001064 across eleven sessions in one afternoon it chose H264

    RFC 3264 section 5.1 makes the ``m=video`` payload-type list a *preference*
    list, most-preferred first.  The offer this module sends carries ``96 97``,
    i.e. it already states a preference for H264 -- so the often-repeated
    shorthand that our offer "expresses no preference" is not what the SDP says.
    What is true is that nothing here ever *chose* that order: the line arrived
    verbatim when this path was extracted from ``client.py`` and has never been
    varied.

    Measured on an A001064, the camera answers H264 most of the time and H265
    occasionally for an otherwise identical request (nine and two across eleven
    sessions one afternoon).  Read against the offer, that is a camera which
    honours our stated first choice most of the time and disregards it some of
    the time -- which is a reason to expect *less* of reordering than of the
    pin, and is recorded here so nobody reads this knob as established.

    Why it is worth having anyway: the efficient profile (hevc 2560x1440 at
    ~1.1 Mbps against h264 1280x720 at 2.5-4.0 Mbps) has only ever appeared when
    BOTH codecs are on the wire.  ``AIDOT_SDES_VIDEO_PT=97`` narrows to H265 and
    returns no video at all, 3 of 3 rounds -- narrowing removes the option
    rather than selecting it.  Reordering is the only untried lever that leaves
    both codecs offered, so the camera can still fall back to H264.

    Accepts a comma- or space-separated payload-type list (``97,96``, ``97``).
    Whatever is named goes first, in the order named; every advertised codec not
    named is appended in the default order.  So this can express a preference
    and can never narrow the offer: the result is always a permutation of the
    full advertised set, and an empty or entirely unusable value yields exactly
    today's order.  Narrowing already has its own variable, and the one time it
    was measured it cost the picture.

    Unknown payload types and duplicates are dropped rather than honoured: a
    payload type this offer does not advertise has no rtpmap to go with it, and
    listing one on the m-line would name a codec the camera was never given the

    A teardown ends one of two ways and BOTH are expected:

    Missing the second case is what made every deliberate stop of an SDES serve
    look like a crash: exit code 255, no stderr at all (ffmpeg's "Exiting
    normally, received signal 15." is INFO and the serve runs at
